# Pok√©mon Copy

A fan-made, educational iOS game built with **SwiftUI** and **SpriteKit**, inspired by the classic Pok√©mon games. Explore maps, encounter wild creatures, and battle in a turn-based system ‚Äî all while learning game development fundamentals on iOS.

## üéÆ About

Pok√©mon Copy lets players wander a tile-based map, trigger random encounters in dark grass, and engage in turn-based battles. The goal of this project was **to explore SpriteKit and game logic**, translating concepts from a JavaScript/HTML Canvas tutorial into Swift, and creating a playable experience entirely programmatically.

Key features include:

- **Tile-based exploration** with proper map borders  
- **Walking animations** for the player character  
- **Random encounters** in designated areas  
- **Turn-based battles** with selectable moves (e.g., Tackle, Fireball)  
- **Background/foreground layering** for immersion  
- **Physics-based collision detection** to handle movement and map boundaries

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Swift**  
- **SwiftUI** for menus and UI elements  
- **SpriteKit** for animations and physics  
- Fully **programmatic scene setup** (no scene editor)

## üß© Development Highlights

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial ‚Äú[Pok√©mon JavaScript Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses)‚Äù by Chris Courses. Translating JavaScript logic into Swift and SpriteKit required creativity and problem-solving, particularly around **player/border collisions**.  

Challenges tackled:

1. **Player-centered movement:** The player sprite stays centered while the map moves behind it.  
2. **Edge collision detection:** Preventing the map from moving when the player collides with a border, while maintaining smooth movement across multiple border tiles.  
   - Implemented **edge detection with counters** rather than simple booleans for robust collision handling.  
3. **Sprite animations:** Running frame-based loops for walking and battle moves.  
4. **Physics tracking:** Detecting when the player enters ‚Äúdark grass‚Äù areas to trigger encounters.  

Most rewarding: Bringing childhood dreams to life by building a game.
